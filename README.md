This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is an app designed to help people find their perfect tattoos. It utilises a google image search API to find the images and displays them. A user can save and unsave the images.

### First run `npm ci` to install all dependencies
### Then run `npm run devstart` to launch the app
### Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it
